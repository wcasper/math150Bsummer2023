| ------------ | --------- |
| A+ | 97-100  |
| A  | 93-96.9 |
| A- | 90-92.9 | 
| B+ | 87-89.9 | 
| B  | 83-86.9 |
| B- | 80-82.9 |

Examples of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to:
1. copying from another student's homework, quiz, or exam;
2. allowing another student to copy your work; and
3. copying homework solutions from online.

You should familiarize yourself with the academic integrity guidelines found in the current student handbook.  Consult the <a target="_parent" href="http://www.fullerton.edu/senate/publications_policies_resolutions/ups/UPS%20300/UPS%20300.021.pdf">University Policy Statement (UPS) 300.021 regarding Academic Dishonesty (link)</a> for details.
