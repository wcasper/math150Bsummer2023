## Policies and expectations
I reserve the right to adjust the policies in this syllabus on a case-by-case basis.

**E-mail**
Please email me from your CSU Fullerton account, as other email addresses may be filtered into my Spam folder.

Allow me 24 hours to respond to your email before sending a follow-up email. My response time may be slower in the evenings or over weekends.

**Attendance and Participation**
If you miss any classes during the first week without notifying the instructor or the departmental office within 24 hours of the meeting, you may be dropped from the course.

Attendance and class participation are important components for success in this course. We will work through assigned in-class problems during our meetings.


**Quizzes and Assigned Readings**
You will be assigned a few sections of material to read prior to most class meetings. These are crucial for your understanding of the material in lectures and participation in in-class assignments.

Lecture assessments and quizzes will be provided through Canvas.
Students will be responsible for completing a lecture assessment of the previous lecture, due the night before the next lecture.

**Homework**
Homework assignments will feature both computational and analytic components.  For the former, the MATLAB code, all image files, any required screenshots, and any necessary written solutions for each assignment will need to be submitted through the course website on Canvas.
For the latter, you will need to provide a written solution which will be uploaded with any relevant code as a PDF document.  Three possible ways of accomplishing this include
* typing your solution in LaTeX on Overleaf and then compiling and downloading the resultant pdf.
* writing your solution and using a scanner or smartphone to scan it as a PDF document and upload it
* using some other word processor such as Microsoft Word to create the document and then export it as a PDF

## Exams
Exams will take place during class at the times stated below.  

If you have an accommodation from Disability Support Services (such as time-and-a-half), it is your responsibility to coordinate with the instructor before each exam.

**Midterm Exams**
There will be two midterm exams, each lasting 1 hour and 50 minutes.
Each midterm will be worth 15\% of your final grade.
Midterms will be held during class time on the following dates:
* Wednesday, March 1, 2023
* Wednesday, April 12, 2023

**Final Exam**
There will be a Final Exam, which will take place during class on the last day.
* Friday 08/04/2023 from 9AM-11:20AM

## Academic integrity
Students who violate university standards of academic integrity are subject to disciplinary sanctions, including failure in the course and suspension from the university. Since dishonesty in any form harms the individual, other students, and the university, policies on academic integrity are strictly enforced. Examples of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to:
1. copying from another student's homework, quiz, or exam;
2. allowing another student to copy your work; and
3. copying homework solutions from online.

You should familiarize yourself with the academic integrity guidelines found in the current student handbook.  Consult the <a target="_parent" href="http://www.fullerton.edu/senate/publications_policies_resolutions/ups/UPS%20300/UPS%20300.021.pdf">University Policy Statement (UPS) 300.021 regarding Academic Dishonesty (link)</a> for details.
