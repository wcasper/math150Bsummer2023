We will be using Webassign to complete the homework for this course, since it
provides students with lots of problems for which they can receive immediate
feedback.

To get started, use the following link

<a href="https://www.getenrolled.com/?courseKey=fullerton35288859">https://www.getenrolled.com/?courseKey=fullerton35288859</a>

1. Click **ENROLL**
2. Review the required materials for the course and click **CONTINUE**
3. Log into Cengage.  If you have never used Webassign before, you will need to create an account.
4. If you already have a Webassign Access Code, enter it now.  Otherwise, click **CONTINUE**
5. You will need to purchase a **Webassign Access Code**.  There are several options available for this.
 - To just get what you need for this semester, the cost is $111.00$ dollars.  This gives you access to an electronic copy of the textbook and to the homework.  This provides access only to this course textbook and only for the current semester.
 - If you will also be taking Calculus III (or potentially retaking Calculus II), you might consider purchasing multi-term access.  The cost is $138.00$ dollars.
 - To get access to all of Cengage's online learning platforms, textbooks, etc. as well an option to rent a hard copy of the textbook, there are additional options.
 - If you have purchased a physical copy of the textbook, it will often come with a Webassign Access Code already.  Check before you buy again!
 - If you have already taken a previous calculus course, there's a chance you already purchased multi-term Webassign access.  In this case, you shouldn't need to repurchase an access code.
6. If you don't want to purchase an access code right away, Webassign provides a two-week trial period.  Click the button **TEMPORARY ACCESS** if you want to take advantage of this trial period first!
