This exam contains \numpages\ pages (including this cover page) and
\numquestions\ problems.  Check to see if any pages are missing.  Enter
all requested information on the top of this page, and put your initials
on the top of every page, in case the pages become separated.\\

You may \textit{not} use your books or notes on this exam.
You may use a single-sided, hand-written note sheet and a basic calculator.

You are required to show your work on each problem on this exam.  The following rules apply:\\

\begin{minipage}[t]{3.7in}
\vspace{0pt}
\begin{itemize}

%\item \textbf{If you use a ``fundamental theorem'' you must indicate this} and explain
%why the theorem may be applied.

\item \textbf{Organize your work}, in a reasonably neat and coherent way, in
the space provided. Work scattered all over the page without a clear ordering will 
receive very little credit.  

\item \textbf{Mysterious or unsupported answers will not receive full
credit}.  A correct answer, unsupported by calculations, explanation,
or algebraic work will receive no credit; an incorrect answer supported
by substantially correct calculations and explanations might still receive
partial credit.  This especially applies to limit calculations.

\item If you need more space, use the back of the pages; clearly indicate when you have done this.

\item \textbf{Box Your Answer} where appropriate, in order to clearly indicate what you consider the answer to the question to be.
\end{itemize}

Do not write in the table to the right.

\question[10]\mbox{}

The national average composite ACT test score for high school seniors in the US last year was $20.8$ with a standard deviation of $5.8$.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item  Write down an integral which represents the probability that a randomly selected test-taker scored between a $30$ and a $36$ on their ACT?
\vspace{2in}
\item  Use the Trapezoid Rule with $n=3$ to approximate the value of the integral in (a).
\end{enumerate}


\newpage
\question[10]\mbox{} 

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item  

As a snowball melts, its radius decreases at a rate proportional to the square root of the radius.  Write down a differential equation describing the rate of change of the radius.

\vspace{4in}
\item 

Solve the initial value problem.

$$y' = 8x(1+y^2),\ \ y(1)=0.$$
\end{enumerate}



\newpage
\question[10]\mbox{} 


\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item  Set up an integral to find the length of the parametric curve
$$x = e^t - t,\ \ y = 4e^{t‚ÅÑ2},\quad 0\leq t\leq 2.$$
\vspace{2in}
\item Find the value of the integral in part (a).
\vspace{3in}

\vspace{4in}

\item
Use integration in polar coordinates to find the area of the region in part (a).

\end{enumerate}

\newpage
\question[10]\mbox{} 

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item

Calculate the limit of the following sequence

$$a_n = \frac{2n^3-n^2+3n-4}{\sqrt{3n^6 + 2n + 4}}.$$

If it diverges, write DIVERGES.

\vspace{3.5in}

\item

Express the decimal expression

$$0.151515151515\dots$$

as a fraction of two whole numbers.

\end{enumerate}


\newpage
\textbf{BONUS QUESTION (5pts):}

Find the value of the integral

$$\int x^{-2}\tan^{-1}(x)dx.$$
