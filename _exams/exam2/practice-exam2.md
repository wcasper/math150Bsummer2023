Solve each of the following problems.
If the problem asks for a proof, be sure to carefully justify your work, including any theorems from class.

Note: you may NOT use a theorem or result from class to prove something when it makes the problem entirely trivial.  If you are unsure whether a particular theorem or result is allowed, just ask!

## Problem 1

In Fall 2022, the average GPA of Electrical Engineering (EE) majors in lower-division courses at CSUF was $$2.4$$ and the standard deviation was $$0.4$$.
Assume that GPA's satisfy a normal distribution.
Use Simpson's Rule with $$n=6$$ to approximate the probability that a randomly selected EE student's GPA was at least a B-, (ie. between $$3.0$$ and $$4.0$$).

## Problem 2

* (a) A $$50$$ kg object is shot from a cannon straight up with an initial velocity of $$10$$ m/s off a bridge that is $$100$$ meters above the ground.  As it moves through the air, it is slowed down by friction caused by air resistence.  Assuming the friction force is proportional to $$-v$$ (with proportionality constant $$k$$), set up a differential equation describing the velocity as a function of time.

* (b) Find a solution of the initial value problem

$$y' = e^{y-t}\sec(y),\ \ y(0) = 0.$$

## Problem 3

Consider the following set of parametric equations

$$\left\lbrace\begin{array}{c}
x(t) = \csc(t)\\
y(t) = \cot(t)\\
\end{array}\right.\quad\text{for}\quad 0 < t <  \pi$$

* (a) Create a plot of the parametric curve above.

* (b) Find the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point $$(\sqrt{2},1)$$.

## Problem 4

Find the area of the region which lies inside both the curve $$r=2\cos(\theta)$$ and the curve $$r=2\sin(\theta)$$.

## Problem 5

* (a)  Determine the limit of the sequence, if it exists.  If it is divergent, then write DIVERGENT.

$$a_n = \left(1 + \frac{2}{n}\right)^n.$$


* (b) Find the value of the sum

$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{12}{n(n+3)}$$


* (c) Express the decimal expression

$$0.123123123123\dots$$

as a fraction of two whole numbers.
