Solve each of the following problems.
If the problem asks for a proof, be sure to carefully justify your work, including any theorems from class.

Note: you may NOT use a theorem or result from class to prove something when it makes the problem entirely trivial.  If you are unsure whether a particular theorem or result is allowed, just ask!

## Problem 1

* (a) Draw a picture of the region bounded by the curve $$y=x^4-4x^2$$ and $$y=x^2-4$$
* (b) Set up an integral whose value is the area of the region in part (a)
* (c) Evaluate the definite integral from (a)

## Problem 2

Consider a tank of the shape featured in the image below.
The density of water is $$62.5\ \text{lb}/\text{ft}^3$$.

* (a) Set up the work required to drain the tank through the pipe at the top.

* (b) Evaluate the total work required.  Make sure to specify your units.


## Problem 3

Evaluate each of the following integrals.

* (a) $$\int_0^1 (x^2+1)e^{-x}$$

* (b) $$\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+2x+5}}dx$$

## Problem 4

Use the specified method to find the volume of the solid of revolution.

* (a) $$y=x(x-1)^2$$ and $$y=0$$ rotated around the $$y$$-axis using the Shell Method

* (b) $$y=e^{-x}$$, $$y=1$$, and $$x=2$$ rotated around $$y=2$$ using the Disk/Washer Method

## Problem 5

Evaluate each of the following integrals.

* (a) $$\int \sec^5(x)\tan^7(x)dx$$

* (b) $$\int \frac{3x+2}{x(x^2+1)}dx$$
