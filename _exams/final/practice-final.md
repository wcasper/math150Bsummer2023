Solve each of the following problems.
If the problem asks for a proof, be sure to carefully justify your work, including any theorems from class.

Note: you may NOT use a theorem or result from class to prove something when it makes the problem entirely trivial.  If you are unsure whether a particular theorem or result is allowed, just ask!

## Problem 1

Consider the region of the plane bounded by the curves $$y=0$$, $$y=x^2+1$$, $$x=0$$ and $$x=1$$.

* (a) Set up, but do not evaluate an integral representing the volume of the solid of revolution obtained by rotating the region around the $$x$$-axis.

* (b) Set up, but do not evaluate an integral representing the volume of the solid of revolution obtained by rotating the region around the line $$y=2$$.

* (c) Set up, but do not evaluate an integral representing the volume of the solid of revolution obtained by rotating the region around the line $$x=1$$ using the Shell Method.

## Problem 2

A spherical tank with a radius of $$5$$ meters is half filled with water.  How much work is required to pump the water out of a whole at the top of the tank?  [Remember: the density of water is $$1000$$ kg/m$$^3$$ and gravitational acceleration is $$9.8$$ m/s$$^2$$.

## Problem 3

Set up, but do not solve, an integral obtaining the arc length of one petal of the four-leaf clover $$r=\cos(2\theta)$$.

## Problem 4

Find the surface area of the shape obtained by rotating the curve

$$y=x^3,\ \ 0\leq x\leq 2$$

around the $$x$$-axis.

## Problem 5

Calculate each of the following integrals

* (a) $$\int (\ln(x))^2dx$$

* (b) $$\int\frac{1}{x^2\sqrt{4x^2+1}}dx$$

* (c) $$\int \frac{x^2-2x-1}{(x-1)^2(x^2+1)}$$

## Problem 6

Determine carefully the limit of each of the following sequences.

* (a) $$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} n\sin(2/n)$$

* (b) $$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \frac{2^n}{n!}$$

* (c) How many terms must we add up in the series $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^5}$$ in order to get the value up to $$5$$ decimal places?

## Problem 7

Determine if each of the following series are absolutely convergent, continuously convergent, or divergent.

* (a) $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n+4^n}{n^2+6^n}$$

* (b) $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^n\cos(\pi/n)$$

## Problem 8

Determine if each of the following series are absolutely convergent, continuously convergent, or divergent.

* (a) $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n+5}{\sqrt[3]{n^7+n^2}}$$

* (b) $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\ln(n)}{n^3}$$

* (c) $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^n\frac{10^n}{(n+1)4^{2n+1}}$$

## Problem 9

Find the radius of convergence and the interval of convergence of the series

$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^n\frac{x^n}{n^25^n}.$$

## Problem 10

* (a) Calculate the Taylor polynomial $$T_8(x)$$ of the function $$f(x)=\sin(2x)$$ based at $$x=0$$.

* (b) Use Taylor's Estimate to bound the error $$\lvert T_8(x)-f(x)\rvert $$ in the interval $$[-0.1,0.1]$$.
